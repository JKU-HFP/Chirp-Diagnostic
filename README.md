# Chirp Diagnostic

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks to evaluate and simulate chirps of laser pulses.

The method is based on the [MOSAIC](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-27-10-860) technique.

The notebooks are to be used as follows:

- Applying MOSAIC filter on measured signal -> Apply_MOSAIC_on_Measured_Signal.ipynb
- Simulating IAC signal with applied MOSAIC filter -> Simulating_IAC_MOSAIC_of_chirped_Laser.ipynb
- Simulating IAC signal + pulse shaper and applied MOSAIC filter -> Simulating_IAC_of_cut-off_chirped_Laser
- Determine chirp of signal with applied MOSAIC filter -> Fitting_MOSAIC_Signal_with_Envelope.ipynb
